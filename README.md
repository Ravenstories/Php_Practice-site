# Php_Practice-site
My repository for the php webpage I created to practice creating connections and sending and recieving forms. My database was used localy with XAMPP.

It still has issues I haven't ironed out yet, and the stilesheet isn't very pretty. 

ToDo:

Improve the login and commentary boxes, so they won't show errors when there are none. 
Improve the index site so it only show selected comments and isn't messy. 
Test the site on a practice server, instead of the local host.
